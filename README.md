OPERATION:

The game consists of these main areas, each corresponding to basic mechanics:
1. A progressive level counter, each composed of 5 rounds.
2. An active enemy to defeat, equipped with a life bar.
3. An active "Combo" with combinations of the respective keys to press to complete it.
4. A timer that shortens as levels are completed. It's possible to complete combos to restore 1.5 seconds, or complete an entire level to restore up to the current maximum.
5. A progression system based on frantic score accumulation and increasing difficulty curve as more game levels are completed.
